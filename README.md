# La-Atelier
<h4>2024W - 1st Semester frontend project - Lambton College</h4>
<br>
This is a simple rental website made as a frontend project by me and my buddies. It is only a mockup website and doesn't actually contain real-world practical design and is made up of HTML and CSS majorly, the reason being that we were not graded for the javascript. :)
